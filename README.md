# Decentralized Document Collaboration

This project implements a decentralized document collaboration platform on the Internet Computer (IC). The platform allows users to create, edit, share documents in real-time, and manage document versions efficiently. It also includes user authentication, access control, and collaboration features.

## Features

- **User Management**:
  - Register users and authenticate them using Principal IDs.
  - Manage access control for documents (owner, editor, viewer).

- **Document Management**:
  - Create, save, and update documents.
  - Track version history for documents.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
  - Real-time collaboration with queuing and merging of changes.
  - Notifications for updates made by collaborators.

- **Version Control**:
  - Document version history is stored.
  - Each version has a timestamp for reference.

- **Search and Filter**:
  - Search documents by title or content.
  - Filter documents by owner or shared status.

- **Efficient Data Storage**:
  - Store document content and metadata in stable variables.
  - Use efficient data structures for version history (e.g., linked lists or arrays).

## Prerequisites

- **Internet Computer SDK (DFINITY SDK)**: Follow the instructions in the [DFINITY Quickstart Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/index.html) to install the SDK.
- **Motoko programming language**: Used for developing the smart contract on the Internet Computer.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Decentralized-Document-Collaboration.git
cd Decentralized-Document-Collaboration
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Follow the instructions in the [Internet Computer SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/index.html) to install the SDK and set up your environment.

### 3. Deploy the Canisters

After setting up the environment, you can deploy the smart contract to the Internet Computer using the following command:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

### 4. Interact with the Application

You can interact with the deployed smart contract via the `dfx` command line. For example:

- To create a new document:

```bash
dfx canister call docollab.createDocument '(Principal.fromText("yourPrincipalID"), "Document Title", "Document Content")'
```

- To retrieve a document:

```bash
dfx canister call docollab.getDocument '(1)'
```

## File Structure

- **main.mo**: The main Motoko source code for the decentralized document collaboration platform.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project (this file).
- **dfx.json**: Configuration file for deploying the canisters on the Internet Computer.
